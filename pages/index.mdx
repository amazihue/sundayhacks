**Impoverished students are systematically discouraged from pursuing tech.**  
Over five weeks, we will be working with very low-income students 
to teach basic computer education and app development. Afterwards, 
participants will showcase their projects at the STEM Fair and can earn scholarships 
for higher education.

**Our goal is to expose very low-income students to computer science and empower them 
to pursue tech.**

**Our participants are:**
- On the economic fringe, either struggling to avoid homelessness or formerly homeless.
- Struggling in school due to housing instability.  
- Exceptionally motivated to improve their lives and break the generational cycle of poverty.  

**Students will:**
- Learn basic computer education and app development
- Collaborate on projects
- Be able to receive scholarships
- Join a life-long mentorship community

**Scholarships**  
Students will have the opportunity to win a variety of scholarships during their participation
in the five-week workshop and the STEM fair.

- Future Aspirations in Tech
- Spirit Award 
- Most Innovative
- Best Project

**Event Details**  
1. Workshops every Sunday (August 23-September 20).
Students will spend five weeks learning basic computer education and project prototyping to ultimately create an app of their own.

2. STEM Fair (September 27, 2020)  
Students will showcase their projects at the STEM fair and be able to earn scholarships for their participation in the workshops.
The event will be held at Lowell Elementary School (625 S 7th Street, San Jose, CA 95112).
